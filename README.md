# GPT-Links

## Description
GPT-Links is an outdated program that used to let ChatGPT access the internet by directly providing a websites information through the textbox of ChatGPT automatically. However, since ChatGPT has that built in now, its kind of dead. But heres the code if you wish to check it out.

## Code Overview
All you need to know is that whenever you paste in a link (via http://content.example or https://content.example), then the scripts will catch the link. It then makes a fetch request, filters down the unnessecary stuff and extracts the main text from the website. Then, it will stimulate the user typing onto ChatGPT with the extracted content and automatically send the data over on the client side.
